## 01 Linear Models for Data with Correlation

A linear model specifies a linear relationship between a dependent variable and n independent variables. 
The dataset used in this exersize is taken from H. Randle, H. Edwards, L. Button (2010). 
"The Effect of Rider Position on the Stride and Step Lengt of the Horse at Canter (Abstract)," 
Journal of Veterinary Behavior, Vol. 5, pp. 219-220. 
The example demonstrates how to parametrise the unknown parameter β of the model y = Xβ + ε (where ε follows normal distribution) 
and compute statistical parametrs such as, e.g. maximum likelihood estimate.
